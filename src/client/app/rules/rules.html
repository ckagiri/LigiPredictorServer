<h4>Rules</h4>
<b>Scoring</b>
<p>
Scores are calculated based on the accuracy of the Prediction and the Actual Outcome of a Match. Points are awarded as follows:
Points
1) 4 points for correctly predicting the winner or draw.
2) 1 point for correctly predicting the goal difference
3) 1 point for each correct team score prediction.
4) 1 point for correctly predicting the actual score.
5) 1 point for each team score prediction of 2 goals or more.
6) 1 point if your prediction score is within 1 goal of the actual score.
(0-10 points)
</p>
<b>Aim</b>
<p>
Each player tries to get as many points as possible, in the event of a tie, the goal difference of the two players will count.
ie If two people are level on points their position in the leaderboard will be determined by goal difference
Goal differenccce
1) For each correct number of goals you predict per team, you gain the number of goals predicted (+1 if 0).
e.g. you predicit 2 and the team scores 2, you gain 2 goals.
2) For each incorrect number of goals you predict per team, you lose the difference in goals.
e.g. you predict 3 and the team scores 1, you lose 2 goals.
3) For each correct match outcome but incorrect final score
  3.1) If difference between predicted and actual goals for a team is 1, you neither lose nor gain goals.for that team
  3.2) If match goal difference and predicted goal difference is equal, you gain one goal.
4) For each score, you gain the lower of the match and prediction absolute goal-differences (+1 if 0).

<b>The Joker card</b>
<p>
